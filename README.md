# DataScientistJobMap
Map of Job Offers built on D3, Python, MySQL

Hi! This is my first repository on GitHub.

My Github user page is https://github.com/andrgig/

You can find the source of DataScientistJobMap at https://github.com/andrgig/DataScientistJobMap.

Here I viz job offerings from www.carreer.stackoverflow.com on a world map using D3 and made it interactive using python and mysql (you can import the db from data/jobsdb.sql). Job_offering refers to April 5th, 2015.

Have fun and let me know what do you think or... improve it! :-)
